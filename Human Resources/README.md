# Human Resources Analytics – Employee Retention Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to predict retention and identify the key factors influencing whether an employee stays or leaves a company.

## 📊 Objective

The goal of this case study is to build a machine learning model that predicts if an employee will stay or leave the organization based on their attributes, such as:

- Satisfaction level
- Last evaluation
- Number of projects
- Average monthly hours
- Time spent at the company
- Work accident history
- Promotion status
- Department and salary

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Employee_retention_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis, preprocessing, visualizations, and model-building steps.
- `dataset/Human_Resources.csv`: Raw dataset used for training and evaluation.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Feature selection and encoding
- Correlation analysis and visualization
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Accuracy comparison between models

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Low satisfaction levels and high working hours are among the top reasons for employee attrition.
- Promotion in the last 5 years and salary levels play a significant role in retention.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning
- Try additional classifiers like XGBoost
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask (future enhancement)
